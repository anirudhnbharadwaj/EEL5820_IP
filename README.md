# EEL5820 - Image Processing
Welcome to the CAP5516_MedicalImageComputing repository! This repository contains my assignments and projects from the Image Processing (IP) course at the University of Central Florida (UCF).

As part of my journey in Computer Vision, I will be uploading a variety of assignments, projects, and code that showcase my work in this exciting field. You will find image processing algorithms implemented here.
